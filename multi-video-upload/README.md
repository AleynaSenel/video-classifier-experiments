# About the Project
This is a simple multi video upload interface built with HTML,CSS and JavaScript.

You can:
- Upload multiple videos
- Add a title,description and tags for each video
- Select a category from a dropdown menu
- Delete any video block you've added

This is not a static page, i used JavaScript to create the elemnts dynamically.When the user selects videos, new blocks are generated with input fields, so i had to write this part inside the script.
