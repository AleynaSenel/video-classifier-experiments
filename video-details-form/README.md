# Video Details
This is a small project i built to practise JavaScript and working with the DOM.
- The user selects a video file
- The selected video is previewed on the page
- Extra fields (description, tags, category) appear after the file is selected

It's all done using plain HTML,CSS,JavaScript.

# Note:
This project was made for learning purposes.
Some parts were written by checking examples and documentation.
I plan to improve and add new features step by step as i continue learning.
